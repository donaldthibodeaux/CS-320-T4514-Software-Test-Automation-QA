How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure code is functional is to take your time when writing the code and test. Testing should be done throughout the code writing process. Testing should include running code and with peer reviews. During this class we used junit testing to test if the code was functional as well as checking code coverage.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Test cases and having a good plan before implenmentation is a good way to ensure the user needs are met.

How do I approach designing software?

My approch for designing software is first to have a good plan. Before any code is written you should have a good idea of what you are writing and what the code is ment to do. You need to know the needs of the end user as well as the investers.
